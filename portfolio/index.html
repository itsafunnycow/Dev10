      <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <img src="images/aboutme.jpg" width="350px" alt="Head Shot" />
      <p>I am a <strong>young engineer</strong> that is <strong>enticed by complex processes</strong>, both
        natural and man made. Ever since the good fortune of having an incredible
        chemistry teacher in high school, my interest in the natural world and
        the ways that we transform and utilize it has branched and grown
        <strong>across the landscape of science</strong>. My education in chemical engineering
        has built upon this curiosity and allowed me to develop a powerful lens
        to observe and analyze the world through. <strong>I have an open mind</strong> about where
        I see my career going, but I know that <strong>I want to continue learning</strong> a
        variety of new skills through a diverse set of experiences. Overall, my
        career goal is to leverage my interest in the natural world to create
        value, push boundaries, and impact
        lives.</p>

      <p>If I had all the time and money needed, you would find me traveling
        to the world's most beautiful landscapes to camp, hike, climb, and explore.
        My favorite place I've visited so far is Zion National Park in Utah. I would
        love to see Alaska, the Swiss Alps, and the Himmalayas someday. You would also
        regularly find me snowboarding down the mountains I am visiting. I've enjoyed
        snowboarding as an escape from reality since I was 13 years old.</p>
      <p>The hobby I am most involved in is volleyball. I played on a competitive
        team for nine years and loved every second of it. Now, I coach a boys club
        team for 17/18 year olds and stay involved in the sport however I can.</p>
